&lt;p&gt;Go é a linguagem desenvolvida pelo Google para resolver problemas da escala que a gigante da tecnologia tem e, sem dúvida, essa linguagem também vai ajudar a turbinar as suas aplicações.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ele é uma das poucas linguagens que surgiu depois dos processadores com múltiplos núcleos e isso fez com que a linguagem tenha mecanismo de concorrência no cerne da linguagem, o que a torna ideal para aplicações na qual são exigidos um alto grau de desempenho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go é uma linguagem enxuta, moderna, compilada (muito rápida), que tem vários recursos que irão te ajudar nos desafios de desenvolver uma aplicação escalável!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
